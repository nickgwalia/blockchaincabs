Making a booking
When you request a booking you will receive an email; this will contain your booking information. The booking is not confirmed until the PHO confirms your booking request by telephone (Please ensure your mobile number is correct at time of booking). If your booking is successful, the driver will carry out your booking at the agreed time and location.

If a driver is not available at the requested time of booking, the booking will not be carried out. If your booking request is unsuccessful, it may be due to the time requested, and so it is advisable to try again specifying a later time, whenever possible.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your registration and booking details are entered correctly. Upon completion of your booking request, we advise you to check the confirmation email to ensure that your booking details are correct. If you notice an error, you must contact the PHO via the contact number provided in the confirmation email. We will not be held liable for any errors made when entering your registration and booking details and you will be charged for the full amount if the booking is not completed as a result.

Planning your journey
It is your responsibility to plan your journey accurately, allowing sufficient time to reach a destination, particularly when checking in for a flight, catching a train, or arriving in time for any other scheduled appointment. We will not be held accountable for any delays which may occur during transit, so it is important that you check your route before booking, and consider the time of travel and length of journey. The PHO will also call you to confirm your booking details and further advice can be obtained at this point.

Quotations
A. Quotations are given on the basis of the most direct route and in the information given by the Users. The route used will be at the discretion of the Company unless the User has requested a particular route, which will be specified in the confirmation letter or invoice.

B. All quotations are given subject to the Company having available a vehicle suiting the User�s requirements at the time of acceptance of this quotation.

C. Unless otherwise stated admission charges, meals, accommodation and coach parking charges are not included in the quoted price and the hirer agrees to pay such charges.

Cancelling a booking
We or the PHO reserve the right to cancel a booking, whether or not payment has been received and given that there is a reasonable amount of time, by giving notice of non-acceptance over the telephone or via email.

If you need to cancel your booking, please contact the Company as soon as possible. If you cancel a booking after the vehicle has been dispatched then a charge may be incurred; the charge will be based on the distance/time that the allocated driver has travelled/spent prior to the point of cancellation.

Payment Terms
If a payment request has been made for 10 days prior to hire, we would expect this to arrive at our office no later than the requested date (please note no reminders are sent), if this is not received this may result in the hire being cancelled. We also request that any further payment terms are met as further interest charges may be incurred.
